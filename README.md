# Snake
Code in js folder has been transpiled from typescript code that you can find inside ts folder.<br>
Game is easly customizable by passing settings as second parameter while creating new Snake.Game instance.<br>
index.html shows example usage.<br>

# Some canvas screens:
<img
  alt="Screen1"
  src="./previews/1.png"
/>

<img
  alt="Screen2"
  src="./previews/2.png"
/>

<img
  alt="Screen3"
  src="./previews/3.png"
/>

Game grid is adjusting automatically to canvas resolution while creating new game instance.

<img
  alt="Screen4"
  src="./previews/4.png"
/>
